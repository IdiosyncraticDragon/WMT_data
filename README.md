# WMT_data (Keep updating)
Preprossed data for workshop on statistical machine translation (WMT), collected from other places

When reimplement the NMT models, I found the data of WMT14/15/16/17 are raw data provided on the homepage, and it is not easy to find processed data which is exactly the paper used. So I creat this repository to collect the processed WMT data I met, which I am sure met the requirment of papers I read.

## WMT 2014

### WMT 2014 English to French

The data is provided at: http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/~schwenk/cslm_joint_paper/

The data is used in these papers:
- Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio: Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate. CoRR abs/1409.0473 (2014)
- Kyunghyun Cho, Bart van Merriënboer, Ça˘glar Gülçehre, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Fethi Bougares, Holger Schwenk, and Yoshua Bengio. Learning phrase representations using rnn encoder–decoder for statistical machine translation. In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1724–1734, 2014.
