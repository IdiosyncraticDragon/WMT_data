# WMT_data
Preprossed data for workshop on statistical machine translation (WMT), collected from other places

When reimplement the NMT models, I found the data of WMT14/15/16/17 are raw data provided on the homepage, and it is not easy to find processed data which is exactly the paper used. So I creat this repository to collect the processed WMT data I met, which I am sure met the requirment of papers I read.
